From learning how to code through Hack Reactor to teaching myself how to create rotoscope animations, if I’m passionate about something, I can accomplish my goals and exceed expectations. I believe that with the right amount of creativity, even the most mundane things can be made exciting and impactful.',
  'I enjoy playing guitar, bass, drums, and piano, creating rotoscope animations, tinkering with video game mods, and luthiery in my spare time.'
